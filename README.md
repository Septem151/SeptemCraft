**SeptemCraft** is a highly opinionated **Forge** modpack for Minecraft version **1.7.10**. This modpack introduces linear ore progression consisting of Vanilla, Thermal, and Tinkers ores, as well as restricts the usage of tools to solely Tinker Tools. Additionally, a ton of recipe modifications for Thermal Expansion machinery and Tinkers alloys are included to make processing progression feel meaningful.

_NOTE: This modpack is in BETA and **does not** have all features implemented_
